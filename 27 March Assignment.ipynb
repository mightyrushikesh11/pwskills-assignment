    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, R-squared tells us how well the linear regression model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains all the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = Explained variance / Total variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The explained variance is the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable, while the total variance is the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can also be interpreted as the percentage of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. For example, an R-squared value of 0.80 means that 80% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R-squared does not necessarily indicate the goodness of fit of the model or the accuracy of the predictions. It only measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. Other factors, such as the sample size, the distribution of the data, and the presence of outliers, can also affect the goodness of fit and the accuracy of the predictions."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in a linear regression model.

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when there are multiple independent variables in a linear regression model. When there are more than one independent variables in the model, the regular R-squared may increase with the addition of each independent variable, regardless of whether the variable is useful in explaining the variance in the dependent variable. This is known as the overfitting problem.\n",

    "The Lasso regularization shrinks the coefficients of the features towards zero, which leads to sparsity in the model, i.e., only a subset of the features have non-zero coefficients.
