    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the idea of bundling data and methods together within a class, so that the data can only be accessed or modified through the methods of the class. This helps to keep the data and methods organized and can prevent unwanted changes to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating new classes from existing classes, which inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class. This allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes with increasing levels of specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms or to have multiple behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding, where different methods can be implemented with the same name but different parameters or behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of focusing on essential features of an object or concept, while ignoring irrelevant details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define the basic structure and behavior of a class, without providing the full implementation. This allows for more flexible and modular design of software systems."
