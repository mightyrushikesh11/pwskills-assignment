    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise in the training data, leading to poor performance on new data. In other words, the model is \"memorizing\" the training data instead of generalizing to new data. Overfitting can result in poor accuracy, high variance, and long training times.\n",

    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and new data. In other words, the model is \"underfitting\" the data and is not able to capture the complexity of the underlying patterns. Underfitting can result in poor accuracy, high bias, and low variance.\n",

    "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, early stopping, or dropout. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage overfitting, while early stopping stops the training when the model starts to overfit.

    "\n",
    "Training and Validation Set Error: One of the most common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting is to split the data into training and validation sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the validation set is used to test the model's performance. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it is likely overfitting. On the other hand, if the model performs poorly on both the training and validation sets, it is likely underfitting.\n",

    "Learning Curve: Another way to detect overfitting and underfitting is to plot the learning curve, which shows the performance of the model on the training and validation sets as the amount of data used to train the model increases. If the training error decreases, but the validation error increases as the amount of data increases, it is likely overfitting. If both the training and validation errors are high, it is likely underfitting.\n",

    "Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to validate the model's performance by dividing the data into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset. If the model performs well on each subset, it is likely that it is not overfitting. However, if the model performs poorly on some subsets, it may be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization Techniques: Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term helps to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent it from overfitting. Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can be used to detect overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that shows the actual and predicted values of the model. It can be used to detect overfitting and underfitting by comparing the number of correct and incorrect predictions. If the model predicts the correct values for the training set but performs poorly on the test set, it may be overfitting. If the model predicts poorly on both sets, it may be underfitting.\n",

    "To determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting, you can use one or more of the above methods. If the model is overfitting, you can try to reduce the model's complexity, use regularization techniques, or increase the amount of training data. If the model is underfitting, you can try to increase the model's complexity, use more features, or increase the amount of training data."

    "A high bias model is one that has a simplified representation of the data and makes assumptions that are not valid. A high bias model can result in a large amount of error due to the model's inability to capture the complexity of the data.

    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "Early stopping is a regularization technique that stops the training of the model before it converges completely. This is done by monitoring the performance of the model on the validation set during training. When the performance on the validation set stops improving, the training is stopped. Early stopping helps to prevent overfitting by avoiding the model to fit the noise in the training data.\n",

It adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to choose simpler parameters and avoid overfitting.
