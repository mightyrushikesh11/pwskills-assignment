    "Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "Machine Learning\n",
    "Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer programs that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, decision making, and natural language processing. AI aims to create machines that can think and act like humans, or even surpass human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves using algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, ML involves training machines to recognize patterns and relationships in large datasets, and then use this knowledge to make predictions or take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to build a spam email filter using ML. You could train a machine learning model on a large dataset of emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam. The model would analyze the features of each email (e.g., subject line, sender, content), learn to recognize patterns that are indicative of spam, and use this knowledge to classify new emails as either spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves training artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes that simulate the functioning of the human brain. DL algorithms use multiple layers of neural networks to extract increasingly complex features from data, and can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n",

    "For example, suppose you want to build an image recognition system using DL. You could train a deep neural network on a large dataset of labeled images, where each image is labeled with the object or scene it contains. The network would learn to recognize increasingly complex features in the images (e.g., edges, shapes, textures), and use this knowledge to classify new images based on their content."

    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the computer is trained on labeled examples to learn how to make predictions or decisions. Labeled examples are input/output pairs, where the input is some data, and the output is the correct answer or label for that data. During training, the computer uses these examples to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs, which it can then use to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Image classification: A computer is trained on a dataset of labeled images to recognize and classify different objects, such as cats, dogs, and cars.\n",

    "Ans. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is trained on a dataset without any labeled examples.

Unsupervised learning algorithms are often used to discover hidden relationships or clusters within data.\n",

    "Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Train, test, and validation split is a common practice in machine learning where the dataset is divided into three parts: a training set, a test set, and a validation set. The purpose of this split is to train a machine learning model on one part of the dataset, evaluate its performance on another part of the dataset, and then use the third part to fine-tune the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each term is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: The training set is used to train the machine learning model. It is the part of the dataset that the model sees during the training process. The model learns from the input/output pairs in the training set and adjusts its parameters to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. The larger the training set, the better the model can learn the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model. It is a part of the dataset that the model has not seen during the training process. The model makes predictions on the input data in the test set, and the predicted outputs are compared to the actual outputs to measure the model's accuracy. The test set is important to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data and does not overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation set: The validation set is used to fine-tune the machine learning model. It is a part of the dataset that is not used during the training process, but is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the tuning process. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set, and the hyperparameters of the model are adjusted to improve its performance. The validation set is important to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the train, test, and validation split is important for ensuring that a machine learning model can learn from data, generalize well to new data, and perform accurately. The training set is used to train the model, the test set is used to evaluate its performance, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model."

    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool in anomaly detection because it can identify patterns in data without prior knowledge of what constitutes normal or abnormal behavior. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data, and it is often used in areas such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, and predictive maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and density estimation, can be used to identify clusters or groups of data points that are similar to each other. These algorithms can then be used to identify data points that do not belong to any cluster or are significantly different from other data points in the same cluster. These data points are likely to be anomalies or outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a credit card fraud detection system, an unsupervised learning algorithm could be used to cluster credit card transactions based on their features, such as the transaction amount, location, and time. The algorithm would then identify transactions that do not belong to any cluster or are significantly different from other transactions in the same cluster. These transactions could be flagged as potential frauds and further investigated.\n",
